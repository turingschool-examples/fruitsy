# Fruitsy

## Project Description

A repository to teach boolean logic. The repo has two classes, a `Fruit` class, and a `FruitDetector` class.

The idea is to instantiate a fruit, pass it onto the fruit detector and identify the type of fruit that we are passing.

The fruit detector method that identifies the type of fruit is `#detect`. This method contains nested if/elses.

The objective for this exercise is to *flatten* the nested if/elses.

There is a test suit that helps you refactor.
